**Step 1: Download Anaconda Python**
- Visit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and download the latest version of Anaconda for macOS.

**Step 2: Install Anaconda Python**
- Once the download is complete, open the downloaded installer file (.pkg) and follow the installation instructions.
- Choose the default installation options unless you have specific requirements.

**Step 3: Open Terminal**
- Launch the Terminal application on your Mac. You can find it in the "Utilities" folder, which is inside the "Applications" folder.

**Step 4: Create a new environment (optional)**
- It's recommended to create a separate environment for Jupyter Notebook. This step is optional but helps isolate your Jupyter environment from your base Anaconda installation.
- Run the following command in the Terminal to create a new environment named "jupyter_env" (you can replace "jupyter_env" with your preferred environment name):

```
conda create --name jupyter_env
```

**Step 5: Activate the environment (optional)**
- If you created a new environment in the previous step, activate it using the following command:

```
conda activate jupyter_env
```

**Step 6: Install Jupyter Notebook**
- Run the following command to install Jupyter Notebook:

```
conda install jupyter
```

**Step 7: Launch Jupyter Notebook**
- To start Jupyter Notebook, run the following command:

```
jupyter notebook
```

- This command will open a web browser window with the Jupyter Notebook interface.
- You can create new notebooks or open existing ones from there.
